I've been accepted into the Master of Science in Information Systems at the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington. It's been a whirlwind of activity since this acceptance, as I've moved up to Seattle, gotten settled in, have gotten used to a new city and have been busy getting prepared as much as possible for the program. Fun and exciting stuff on many levels! 

First of all, Seattle is a pretty new experience for me. Even though I lived in Porltand which is only a few hours away, I never made it up here for the six years that I lived there. Hard to believe, but true! But, I'm loving this city - it feels like nature is close at hand, with the water and mountains never far away, and the cultural options are world-class. Last week I attended both the opera Carmen and a Brahms concerto at the Symphony. Plus, the weather has been amazing, so it has been fun settling in and getting used to my new home )

Additionally, the program is going to be very interesting and is already pushing me to learn Python to get ready for machine learning, as well as blow off the dust off my cloud computing knowledge and skills. But it's all really interesting things and I'm excited to be learning all this, so I'm excited to be pushed in all of these areas :)

A new adventure!
