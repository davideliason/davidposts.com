I've always been interested in the intersection of physical art materials (especially wood and glass with lighting elements), and interwining interactivity with a deeper conceptual component. 'BSG Enigma' was my first art installation in approaching all of those elements, and in this blog post I'll share my process and experience in doing so.

SOAK is a regional Burning Man festival which emphasizes interactive art, and for 2018 the theme was "Parallel Universe." To me, that immediately made me think of the (fantastic) sci-fi series Battlestar Galactica, which explicitly delved into parallel universes in terms of time and perspective. Anyone who has watched this series will have been introduced to some pretty interesting metaphysical and mystical elements, and it was this area that I wanted to focus upon.

With three months before the festival starting on May 24th, 2018, I decided to volunteer at the makerspace ADX, located in Portland, to build community and also have access to the wide variety of tools. I built much of the project there in the ADX facilities, learning the tools, and learning techniques from a number of artists who worked there.

One of the tools that I used quite a bit was the table saw, along with the drop saw, for cutting the wood pieces.

Another favorite tool of makers is the laser-cutting machine, which was used to precisely cut out thin sheets of wood (pine) for (in this case, the Raspberry Pi).

Before actually using the Epilog laser cutter, I used Adobe Illustrator for creating the cutting image. This is done by creating vector-based graphics, and then assigning line widths to either tell the Epilog to cut the line, or simply "burn" the image.

I was interested in combining different wood types (the aesthetic is amazing!), and here's a piece that I started out with:
