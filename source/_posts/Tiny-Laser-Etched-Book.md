i love books! I've thought about taking book binding courses, but that hasn't happened yet so as one of my earlier projects I thought that I would make my own.

I started out with a beautiful piece of wood, and since I like to keep my art pieces as small and lightweight as possible, I cute it down to 2" x 2".

Then, I scanned in an image that I liked, turned it into a vector image, and set the images lines to a width so that the laser-cutter would know to burn, not cut, the lines into the wood.

I liked how it came out!
