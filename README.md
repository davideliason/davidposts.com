## About
I had created a blog using Jekyll and served on Github, but I always had challenges around it, and there was a lot of "black boxes" which made any tweaks feel mysterious.

Finally, after having created a number of posts, I started receiving build errors, and that black box aspect really was problematic.

Since I have already been working on utilizing AWS resources, I decided to build my own blog using a S3 bucket and my own domain. I decided to use Hexo to do so.

## Quick resources
